# Feature Engineering and Model Evaluation with Synthetic Data
In this project, I delved into the process of feature engineering and model evaluation using a synthetic dataset. The steps included generating data, creating polynomial features, scaling, selecting features, and evaluating models.
## Objective:
The primary objective was to highlight the importance of feature engineering and model evaluation in machine learning. By working with a synthetic dataset, I gained hands-on experience with crucial preprocessing techniques.
This repository aims to provide a clear and well-explained guide to these processes.
## Introduction
I created a synthetic dataset using the make_classification function from scikit-learn. The dataset contained 1000 samples and 20 features, with an imbalanced class distribution.
# Libraries:
To effectively process the data, I used the following Python libraries:
- pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: For numerical operations.
- scikit-learn: For data generation, preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation.
- matplotlib and seaborn: For data visualization.
  # Data Preparation and Feature Engineering:
### Step 1: Generate the Synthetic Dataset
I generated a synthetic dataset and converted it into a pandas DataFrame for easier manipulation and analysis.
### Step 2: Create Polynomial Features
I created polynomial and interaction features up to the second degree using PolynomialFeatures.
### Step 3: Scale the Features
The features were scaled to the range [0, 1] using MinMaxScaler.

### Step 4: Feature Selection
I applied two feature selection methods: SelectKBest with ANOVA F-value and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) with Logistic Regression.
# Model Building and Evaluation:
### Step 5: Model Building and Evaluation
I built and evaluated models using a Decision Tree Classifier with all features, SelectKBest features, and RFE features. The performance of each model was assessed using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
## Visualizations:
I visualized the correlation matrix of the features using a heatmap to understand the relationships between features.
# Conclusion:
The final outcome of this task was a comprehensive script that demonstrated the entire process of feature engineering and model evaluation using a synthetic dataset. This project served as a valuable reference for understanding the importance of preprocessing in achieving robust and reliable machine learning models.
